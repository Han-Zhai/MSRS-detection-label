# MSRS-detection-label
This is the detection label of MSRS dataset.
We give annotations for fusion images, visible images, and infrared images respectively. The label of the dataset contains three categories $i.e.$ person, bicycle and car.
The RoadScene_Annotation dataset is annotated with 121 aligned Vis and IR image pairs selected from RoadScene(https://github.com/hanna-xu/RoadScene). For each instance, 14 semantic categories are defined and annotated except for the "background" category, i.e. “sky”, “tree”, “car”, “bicyclist”, “road”, “pavement”, “grass”, “fence”, “pedestrian”, “roadsign”, “building”, “pole”, “wire”, “light”. Each instance has annotations whenever the corresponding category appears in the current image.
